  Race for Life have launched a new iOS and Android app that will enable participants of the charityâ€™s annual race to raise more money, more easily and motivate them every step of the way. The interface is designed to complement how the app is used. For example, the speed of the runner at the bottom of the screen animates to support whether you walk, jog or run your race. A custom transition brings race details infront, changes the header bar from pink to blue and displays an overview of relevant information. Bespoke animations and rich interactions provide a quick tour of the app, built using an open source library. The JustGiving API integration transforms the way participants manage their sponsorship efforts in a bid to maximise fundraising.
