description: |
  James Heather is a musician from London. For his music project, James asked Suki to design artwork inspired by his music and life experiences. Each piece on the album is an evocative, melancholic and tender story of hope. To visually capture the narrative, a collage of pieced photography, hand paintings and digital renders are layered to create conscious darkness, juxtaposed with warm perceptive focus.
